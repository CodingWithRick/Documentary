              Hawa Mahal (English translation: "The Palace of Winds" or "The
              Palace of Breeze") is a palace in Jaipur, India approximately 300
              kilometers from the capital city of Delhi. Built from red and pink
              sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur,
              and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was
              built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of
              Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so
              inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built
              this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand
              Ustad. Its five floor exterior is akin to honeycomb with its 953
              small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate
              latticework.

              The City Palace, Jaipur was established at the same time as the
              city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his
              court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Jaipur is the present-day
              capital of the state of Rajasthan, and until 1949 the City Palace
              was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of
              Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural
              events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It
              now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues
              to be the home of the Jaipur royal family. The royal family of
              Jaipur is said to be the descendants of Lord Rama. The palace
              complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries,
              restaurants, and offices of the Museum Trust. The Maharaja Sawai
              Man Singh II Museum Trust looks after the Museum, and the royal
              cenotaphs (known as chhatris).

              The Jantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen architectural
              astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai jai singh
              II, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed
              in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a
              UNESCO World Heritage site. It is located near City Palace and
              Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical
              positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the
              Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many
              civilizations.
